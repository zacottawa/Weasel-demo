# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew update

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.profile if ~/.bashrc doesn't exist

nvm --version



nvm install 20
nvm use 20

npm install

npm i -D hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

on host terminal:
npx hardhat node

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

npx hardhat run scripts/story_demo.js --network localhost
